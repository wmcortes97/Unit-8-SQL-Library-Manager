## Unit 8 SQL Library Manager

In this project, I created a library manager that is connected to a database that holds book information. Using express, I created routes that served to help create, update, and remove books.

## How to install

Using npm i and npm start should download the necessary dependencies. If no problems, there should be a message logged in the terminal that states the connection to the database is successful.
